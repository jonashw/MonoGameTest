#MonoGame Test
This project contains a single, controllable character.  It was my first crack at using MonoGame for interactive graphics.

The character is implemented as a Finite State Machine with the following states:

- Idle
- Ducking
- Running
- Sliding
- Jumping
- "Hooray"
- Cannonball
- Cannonball "Crash"
- Cannonball "Crash Recovery"
